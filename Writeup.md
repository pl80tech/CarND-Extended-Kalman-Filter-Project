## About Extended Kalman Filter Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements
* Obtain RMSE values that are lower than the tolerance outlined in the project rubric

More detail explanation can be found in [README](https://github.com/pl80tech/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/blob/master/README.md)
